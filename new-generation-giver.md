# New Generation Givers
#### Tophs Celestial, July 3, 2019

We are in the peak of technology and we are moving fast. We have the Internet and every information we need is just a click away. We are in the social media era, and we are the new generation givers.

> What does it mean to be a giver in this generation where everyone seems to know everything?

I think that it is harder to be a giver in today’s generation than the previous generations. Why? We are a generation that has access to most (if not all) things this world could bring even without going outside. This makes us want more. Social media tends to show us things that we are missing. Time after time, the more things we see, the more we want to have. With these wants in our mind, we tend to put more effort on acquiring and set aside giving.

Humans are greedy in nature, when God told Moses to tell the Israelites to just keep enough Manna for the day, they kept more and found out themselves that all of it was spoiled the next day (Exodus 16). But they still kept it because they have fears. We naturally have fears. We are afraid of pain, suffering, hunger, hardship and various things. Even today, most of us are afraid to be left behind, that’s why we are jealous of the people who possess the things/skills that we want. Because of this, we tend to give less and less. We think that if we take more and give less, then we'll have more. We are just being practical with this belief.

Biblically speaking, taking more and giving less to have more is an equation of this world, from the god of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4). We might not notice it but this equation leads us to pursue worldly prosperity and success. All things that are luxurious are under it. The truth about this is we could never have enough money to buy them all. Like buying the latest gadget just days after buying the older model, a better car compare to the decent one that we’re using, a larger home compared to a 2-bedroom for a family of three. I admit, these are all good stuffs that can make us happy after acquiring them. **BUT**, running towards these goals is like running towards the finish line where the finish line itself is constantly running away faster than we are.

> But seek first His kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. - Matthew 6:33 (better if you read Matthew 6:25-33)

Matthew 6:33 is an illustration of God’s wisdom. When turn towards Him, He will not run away. The moment that we gave in ourselves to repentance and ask God for forgiveness, our lives take a 180-degree turn and we’ll see that He is always following us while we are chasing the world. That He has been waiting for us this whole time (Luke 15:11-32). His wisdom shows that when we began to walk (not run, because we are calm and we don’t need to hustle up ourselves) with Him, the world will begin to chase us. The world and everything in it will begin to chase us. This is the meaning of Biblical Prosperity. This is the prosperity that God promised us in John 10:10b. Life of abundance.

### How to practice being a giver?
------
1. **Learn to listen to God**
> This is the fundamental of being a giver. If you ever read the book of Proverbs, God wanted us to have wisdom from Him and to be wise. How would you know if it is God who told you to give? If a voice is telling you to give and help, it is from God. The voice of the enemy is always telling us that we don’t have enough for ourselves and that we should not give.
2. **Keep track of the good soil** 
> have you ever tried giving someone or some place a blessing and then suddenly a blessing comes your way? These could be a good soil that you’ve sown into. Keep track of them, and if the voice from God tells you to sow, sow to this soil.
3. **Try to plow and water the bad soil**
> Bad soil are ones who take advantage of the givers. They tend to extract as many seeds from them and at the end of the day, will not bear fruit. I advice you to stop sowing to this soil, and try to plow them. Share words of God. Hope from Him. Plow them and give them water (e.g. good deeds and word of God), then let God convert them into a good soil. Until then, your sowing to their life will become much better.
4. **Avoid some soil**
> There are good soil, and there are bad soil, and there are soil that are good but not ours to sow to. Wait what? It is for the purpose of teaching and encouraging others to sow. In order for other people to learn how to sow, give a place to sow.
5. **Ask advice**
> Sometimes, we are guided by our emotions that we tend to sow our seeds to the bad soil. First and foremost ask guidance from the Lord, then ask for wisdom from other people. Most of the time we cannot see the bigger picture because we are inside of it. Ask someone who is outside. These are probably the leaders, mentors and friends whom you deeply know.
6. **Invest in the Kingdom**
> Matthew 6:33 is saying that if we invest in the Kingdom. Church works and missions are some example of investing in the Kingdom of God. And as the last half says, “and everything shall be added unto you as well”.
7. **Forget that you give**
> Matthew 6:3 “But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,”. Giving should be done in secret. Always give back the glory to God. I do this by saying to the person, “If someone asks to where this came from, please say that this is from the Lord”.
8. **Remember that God owes you**
> Not that God is in debt to you in a bad way. God is a promise keeper. When He say He will bless He do. And giving is an act of obedience, and in every obedience there is a reward from Him. Do not expect for something in return and remember God's promise.
